I cannot confirm that everything in this document is 100% accurate, but I'd safely say it's around 95%+.
Remember, if you're unsure about ANYTHING, caiefinder.com and the official syllabus are your best friends.

As always, make your own notes / reference sheet to help with memorisation, these are only for reference and initial learning.
